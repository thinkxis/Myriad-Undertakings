# Icons Undertaking
In 2014 Dipesh Bhoir developed Betterfonts. A very reliable way to use 750 asia centric icons.
In 2018 the project found new life as Dakshin icons and soon evolved into iconwho.com
We are working on turning iconwho in a platform to trade zip files. A new data Bazaar section is in early stage. 
Consider helping us with tips in link below.
Currently we depend on contrubutions to keep the project running.
